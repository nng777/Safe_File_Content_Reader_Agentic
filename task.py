TASK:
The task is to design and build a safe autonomous AI agent in Python that reads the contents of a specified file.

Requirements:
1.Agent Goal: The agent's goal is to read the contents of a file at a given path and display them to the user.
2.Tool: The agent should have access to a single tool that reads a file's content. You can simulate this with Python's built-in file handling.
3.Safety Measures:
  3.1.The agent must ask for user confirmation before reading the file.
  3.2.The agent must handle the case where the file does not exist.
  3.3.The agent should include robust error handling for any other potential issues.
